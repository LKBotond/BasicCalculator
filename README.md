# BasicCalculator
This is a basic calculator without a GUI. 
Iâ€™m currently learning c++
This is a practice project.
I created a basic calculator to practice basic syntax, operations, loops, and formatting.
The loops are in place to make sure that invalid input does not break the logic of the program.
